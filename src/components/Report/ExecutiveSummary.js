              Over the past year, there has been a significant increase in awareness and attention paid to blockchain gaming. Numerous, large brands including Meta, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Selfridges and Balenciaga have announced their intention to invest and nurture experiences in the metaverse. However, there is a clear gap in the availability of rich, data-driven perspectives on this market. Insights are limited to the macro level i.e. number of games launched, growth in the total player base or market cap, etc. and there does not appear to be any publicly available data to help us understand the individuals who are actually playing blockchain games i.e. who they are, what their preferences are, and how they make choices.
